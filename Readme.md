# **Airport Gate Management System**
A Java Spring Boot application for efficient scheduling and allocation of airport 
gates, designed to streamline operations and improve airport resource management.

> **Description of the task:**
>
> Create a REST service that manages available gates for planes to park at an
> airport. The REST service should accept a flight number and return the
> assigned gate. The service appropriate response should be returned from
> the REST service.

> **Technical Requirements**
> - The gates and flights should be managed in a relational database.
> - Any database errors should be handled gracefully.
> - The solution should use spring and hibernate frameworks.
> - It should be thread safe and able to handle multiple concurrent requests.
> - The code should be written so that it is as simple as possible for
    > administrators and other developers to follow and debug any issues.

> Extra Challenge
> - Update the solution so that certain gates are only available between certain
    times. If a request for a gate arrives to the REST service at a specific
    time,
    the service should check what gates are available at the current time as
    well
    as whether they are currently in use.

## üì¶ Package by Feature
- In this project structure, packages contain all classes required for a feature.
- This eliminates cross-package dependencies and keeps classes within a package closely related.
- As a result, packages have **high cohesion**, **low coupling**, and **higher modularity**.

### Advantages of Package by Feature:
- High cohesion, low coupling, and modularity.
- Better encapsulation (more classes can be package-private).
- Reduced navigation across packages.
- Scales better than package-by-layer as the application grows.
- Closer to microservice-style organization.
